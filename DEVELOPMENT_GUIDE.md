### How It Works
```python
# 1. Import necessary libraries
from intro_gemini.utils import get_key
from google import genai

# 2. Create a client connection
client = genai.Client(api_key=get_key())

# 3. Start a conversation loop
while True:
    question = input('[User]: ')
    if question == 'exit' or question == 'quit':
        break

    # 4. Generate AI response
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        contents=[question]
    )
    print('[GenAI]:', response.text)
```

### Key Concepts Explained
- **Client**: The connection to Google's AI service
- **Model**: The AI model being used (`gemini-2.0-flash`)
- **Contents**: The input you send to the AI
- **Response**: What the AI sends back

### Try It Out
1. Run the script: `python tutorial01.py`
2. Type a question like "What is Python?"
3. See the AI response
4. Type "exit" to quit

### Common Questions
- **Q**: Why does the AI give different answers each time?
- **A**: AI models can be non-deterministic, meaning they might give slightly different responses to the same question.

### How It Works
```python
# 1. Create a chat session (this remembers the conversation)
chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')

# 2. Send messages to the same chat session
response = chat.send_message(message=question)

# 3. View conversation history
for message in chat.get_history():
    print(f'role - {message.role}: {message.parts[0].text}')
```

### Key Concepts Explained
- **Chat Session**: A persistent conversation that remembers previous messages
- **Message History**: All the back-and-forth conversation stored in the session
- **Role**: Whether a message is from the user or the AI

### Try It Out
1. Run: `python tutorial02.py`
2. Ask: "What is my name?"
3. The AI will say it doesn't know
4. Tell it: "My name is Alex"
5. Ask again: "What is my name?"
6. Now it remembers!

### Why This Matters
- **Tutorial 1**: AI forgets everything after each question
- **Tutorial 2**: AI remembers the entire conversation
- This is crucial for building useful AI assistants!

# 2. Create configuration with system instructions
config = genai.types.GenerateContentConfig(system_instruction=system_prompt)

# 3. Use the config when generating responses
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    contents=[question],
    config=config
)
```

### Key Concepts Explained
- **System Prompt**: Instructions that tell the AI how to behave

- Combining multiple AI concepts

### How It Works
```python
# 1. Create a chat session
chat = client.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash')

# 2. Send the system prompt as the first message
chat.send_message(message="You are a cat. You will answer questions as a cat. Convert words to meow, meoow, meooww, etc. based on the length of the word. ONLY MEOWS ALLOWED. No matter what the question is, you must respond with meows only.")

# 3. Continue the conversation with the established personality
response = chat.send_message(message=question)
```

### Key Concepts Explained
- **First Message**: Sets the tone for the entire conversation
- **Consistent Behavior**: The AI maintains the cat personality throughout
- **Memory + Personality**: Combines the best of both approaches

### Try It Out
1. Run: `python tutorial04.py`
2. The AI will immediately act like a cat
3. Ask multiple questions - it stays in character!
4. Notice how it remembers the conversation AND the personality
